# Some requirement for FFI has changed, and macOS crashes because of a
# sign mismatch ("expected return to have type code 'q', but found 'Q'")
# This workaround disables the problematic check entirely.
# objc2 0.6+ has a better workaround that only disables sign conversion
# checks, see https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/issues/765#issuecomment-2996136843,
# and new winit versions are enabling this by default: https://github.com/madsmtm/objc2/issues/765.
# When that has landed and Bevy has updated to a new winit version this workaround should be removed.
